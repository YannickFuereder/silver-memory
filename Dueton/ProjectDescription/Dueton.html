      <h1>Introduction</h2>
      <h2>Why you NEED Dueton in your life?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever listened to a song and wondered what the lyrics are?
        Or which artists produced this great song? Have u ever wondered where to look for new songs
        or how many other people like this type of songs? <em>Dueton</em> answers all this and much more!
      </p>

      <h2>What's up with the static site?</h2>
      <p>
        There are so many music streaming out there. Appple Music, YouTube Music, Spotify and Soundcloud
        are just a few of them. But which should you use? Our static site tries to compare these services
        and many more to help you make the right choice.
      </p>

      <h2>Team</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of this project we are a two-man-organization.
        Me <a href="https://github.com/Eli-Dev">Elias Gstallnig</a> and my partner <a href="https://github.com/YannickFuereder">Yannick Füreder</a>
        are two highly motivated programmers, just waiting for a new challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is intended to be a project for our school (<a href="https://www.htl-leonding.at/">HTBLA Leonding</a>),
        Because of this there is no monetization (not in form of ads nor with the use of paywalls)
        planned and the product will be open source on <a href="https://github.com/Dueton">our organizations github</a>
        However we also have some personal interests in Dueton and would really like to see it becomming a success.
        In this case we would also maintain it after the submissions.
      </p>

      <h1>Technical and lawfull requirements and restrictions</h1>

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>
        At the point of planning this project neither of us has a server at home
        or is planning on renting one.
        If the website is a success we are hopping that we'll be allowed to use
        school-servers to host it. If that won't be the case we'll eventually try
        and come up with a budget for a small VPS.
      </p>

      <h2>Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        When Dueton is released to the public, we are going to need an Imprint
        as well as a privacy document in compliance with the DSGVO of the EU.
        Because we're both minors and our parents wouldn't agree to stating our
        adress, names and phone number on publicly, we also hope on help from our school here.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h1>Goals</h1>

      <h2>Dynamic WebT Part</h2>
      <p>
        On the landing page you'll see some songs and artists we cherrypicked for you
        (to identify you we'll need to implement an account-system). If you click on a song there
        or use our search-feature you'll see a pretty detailed page about it (there'll things like
        lyrics, artist (also clickable, artist-detail page will be explained later), a small song-preview
        (or start playing it directly in spotify if connected) and links to all major streaming services).
        If added from a user, there'll also be a music video from YouTube embeded.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the Artist-Pages I mentioned before: There'll be some great-looking graphs about follower-growth on all major platforms,
        daily/weekly streams, estimated earnings, a few top songs and some similar artists you might like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, we will try to create a program that automatically collects the most viewed/listened songs in the last month
        and creates a top list. If possible it will also maintain a spotify playlist with this songs.
      </p>

      <h2>Static Site</h2>
      <p>
        The static part of Dueton will be a comparison of all major
        (and also a few smaller) streaming services. This will be based on points
        in categories like user-friendliness, variation of abo-models, prices,
        song-availability, legal restrictions and so on.
        We'll also elect winners for different type of peopele like families,
        individuals, music enthusiasts, ... .
      </p>

      <h2>Personal goals</h2>
      <p>
        We hope to learn and expand our knowledge
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL-Databases, web-APIs and much more.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Planning</h1>

      <h2>Who will be our users?</h2>
      <p>
        People that like music and already use streaming services (Spotify alone has <em>358 milion paying users</em>!)
        don't like searching google for every single detail of a song (lyrics, artists, videos, all platform-links, stats, etc.).
        <br>Or others that just want to find new songs.
        <br>Or fans wanting to follow their favourite artist, see every new release and their stats.
      </p>

      <h2>Important milestones</h2>
      <p>
        The next important thing (after this project-proposal) will be to recherche and code the static site. After that is done,
        we'll start with the dynamic part. There we'll begin with exploring some APIs (like the ones from Spotify, iTunes, Genius, Soundcloud, etc.).
        With this knowledge in mind we'll program the detailed-song pages, the search feature and the artist-pages. When that is done we'll implement
        the top song-ranking. And last but not least we'll do everything account related like personalized landing page, favourite artists,
        spotify integration, and so much more.
      </p>
